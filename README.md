## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps Performed

1. Opened the CSV dataset and ensured headers and delimiters were correctly recognized.
2. Froze the top row and applied filters to all columns for easy data exploration.
3. Created a backup of the raw dataset to avoid accidental data loss.
4. Identified missing values in columns like director, cast, country, and date_added.
5. Checked and removed duplicate records using key columns such as show_id and title.
6. Cleaned text fields using functions like:
   - TRIM() to remove extra spaces
   - PROPER() to standardize text formatting
7. Validated and corrected data formats:
   - Date columns were formatted properly
   - Numeric and categorical columns were checked for consistency
8. Created a separate **Cleaned_Data** sheet to maintain separation between raw and cleaned data.
9. Added a **Data_Quality_Notes** column to document data issues and cleaning decisions.
10. Exported the cleaned data into Excel and CSV formats.
